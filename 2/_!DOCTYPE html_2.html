    <h4> The founder of Raspberry Pie is EbenUpton,and the development organization is the
        Raspberry Pie Foundation.
        <br>This device was released in 2012 and uses Linux system.It is a
        small,low-cost microcontroller computer development
        <br> board with a memory capacity ranging from 256 MB to 8 GB.It is designed as a small computer the size of a credit card,
       <br> aimed at supporting computer programming education.Raspberry pie has a wide range
        of uses,ranging from learning to
        <br> write computer programs in Python to tracking aircraft
        routes.Raspberry pie is also an ideal tool for learning programming
        <br> and hardware,supporting multiple programming languages includingC, C++, Python, Rust, Go, andJavascript.It can also be
        <br> used in conjunction with various interesting external devices,such as 3D printers,cameras,and ADS-B receivers.</h4>

    <h2>1.Education</h2>
        <br><h4>The Raspberry Pie Foundation has take nmeasures to accumulate software developers
        and teachers.The foundation also started with<br> its teacher training organization to
        train teachers in a more precise way.Intended to update teachers through modern
        curriculum.</h4>
        <h2>2.Home automation</h2>
        <h4>Home automation is basically a smart home controlled by automation systems.Can
            control security cameras,vault security systems,climate <br>in different rooms,power
            supply,and all house hold appliances present in the home(refrigerator,washing
            machine,microwave,etc.).</h4>
        <h2>3.Industrial automation</h2>
        <br><h4>In2014,Mod Berry was issued by TECHBASE(a well-known automation
            manufacturerinPoland).This is a computer used for industrial <br>purposes,built using
            a Raspberry computing model.This device also has some other advantages,such as
            theRS-485/232serialport,1-wirebus,etc.<br>The computer quickly became popular
            after being launched on the market.
            Raspberry pie also offer sdifferent products with excellent usability.<br>Raspberry Pie

            has a Raspberry Pie computing module that<br> can efficiently and ideally run the camera.</h4>
        <h2>4.Artificial Intelligence Assistant</h2>
       <br><h4>Raspberry Pie has partnered with Google to propose a hardware suite that will use
        Google's cloud voice API and assistant software development<br> suite to interpret
        natural language or speech.</h4>
        <h2>5.Photography</h2>
       <h4> Raspberry pie can help capture long-lasting photos of many photographers.Raspberry
        pie No IR cameras can be used as artificial intelligence cameras.</h4>
        <h2>6.Programming</h2>
        <br><h4>Raspberry Pie can learn programming,and those who are already capable of
            programming can use Pie to learn electronic products for physical projects.</h4>

    <h2>Arduino IDE</h2>
    <h4> The Arduino Integrated Development Environment(IDE)is the primary text editing
    program used for programming Arduino.Before uploading the code to<br> the circuit
    board you want to program,you can input the code into it.The Arduino code is
    called a sketch.</h4>
    <img src="8.png" width="350" height="350" />
    <h4>There are 5 submenus on the menu bar,and a series of buttons below are available
        for you to verify and upload sketches.The IDE translates and compiles <br>your sketch
        into code that Arduino can understand.Once the Arduino code is compiled,it will be
        uploaded to the memory of the circuit board.</h4>
        <img src="11.png" width="500" height="350" />
    <h4>If there are any errors in the Arduino code,a warning message will be marked to
        prompt the user to make changes.</h4>
        <img src="10.png" width="500" height="350" />
    <h2>Serial monitor and serial plotter</h2>
        <h4>You can open the Arduino Serial Monitor by clicking on the magnifying glass icon in
    the upper right corner of the IDE<br> or below the tools.Serial monitors are mainly used
    to interact with computers and Arduino boards,and are a good tool for<br> real-time
    monitoring and debugging.
    The Arduino Serial Plotter is another component of the Arduino IDE that allows you<br>
    to generate real-time graphics of serial data.Serial plotters make it easier for you to
    analyze data through visual displays.<br>You can create charts,negative value charts,
    and perform waveform analysis.</h4>

<h2>Arduino's Programming Language One</h2>
<h4>An Arduino script code(SKETCH)consists of two parts</h4>
<h2>Void setup()</h2>
<h4>Place a program to initialize the Arduino board vwithin the scope of this function-a
    command to properly install the Arduino <br>board before the main program begins
    writing.</h4>
<h2>Void loop()</h2>
<h4>Place your Arduino scrip there.This part of the program will be executed repeatedly
    until the Arduino board is closed.</h4>

<h2>Case1:The Ocean Clean up</h2>
<h4>The Ocean Clean up is a non-profit organisation that works in two parts:
    cleaning up Marine litter;Intercept river litter.<br>The goal is to remove 90%
    of floating Marine debrisby 2040.In the case of Marine debris,they used
    computer models to<br> locate areas where trash accumulates.Then,two
    boats were used to set up a U-shaped barrier,using the difference in
    current<br> speed to collect garbage.Finally,the garbage is sent a shore
    regularly for recycling.
    In terms of river waste,they provide a<br> variety of interceptors according to
    the characteristics of different rivers.
    <br>Advantages:Creative,outstanding contribution to<br> environmental
    protection,important for the environmental protection of rivers and
    oceans.Can clean up the garbage and<br> protect the aquatic animals at the
    same time.
   <br>Disadvantages:High construction costs,equipment damage in the sea is
    difficult<br> to recover,but also will increase pollution.</h4>

<h2>Case2:mWater</h2>
<h4>mWater is a water data platform that enables governments,utilities,water
    management agencies andother customers to collect,<br>analyze,and share
    water-related data.
    In 2010,adevastating 7.0 - magnitude earthquake devastated Haiti's
    drinking water and<br> sanitation systems,leading to a cholera outbreak.
    mWater assisted the Haitian Government's Water and Sanitation
    Department<br> in establishing a geographic database of drinking water
    sources and sanitation facilities.This has helped the Haitian government<br>
    rebuild water and sanitation infrastructure.
    <br>Advantages:real-time data monitoring and analysis,help crisis response,
    data sharing,customizable advantages.
   <br> Disadvantages:There are data security problems and high initial
    investment disadvantages.</h4>

<h2>Case3:Wild life Insights</h2>
<h4>Wild life Insights is a wild life conservation program run by the World
    Wildlife Fund.The project brings together wild life photos<br> from more than
    1,600 camera traps around the world,using AI models to automatically
    identify animals in the images.The project<br> shares data in an open,visual
    form to engage researchers and the public in wildlife conservation.
    <br>Camera trap:Adevice that automatically takes photos or videos when it
    senses animal activity.
    <br>Advantages:It has efficient data processing capacity,which can help the
    research and protection of land animals.
    <br>Disadvantages:May cause ecological interference,technical update and
    high maintenance costs.</h4>
