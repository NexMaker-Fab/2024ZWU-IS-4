                    <h2>Laser cutting machine cuts leather</h2>
                    <h4>Cutting effect:
                        <br>The laser cutting machine has a very good cutting effect on leather, which can achieve high cutting accuracy, fast speed, accurate cutting size, and smooth cutting edges. This is an advantage that traditional mechanical cutting machines cannot achieve.
                        <br>
                        <br>Parameter settings:
                        <br>Before laser cutting, it is necessary to set corresponding parameters based on the thickness, hardness, color and other properties of the leather material. These parameters include laser power, laser frequency, scanning speed, and focal length.
                        <br>
                        <br>Laser power: The laser power needs to be adjusted according to the thickness and hardness of the leather material. Generally speaking, thinner and softer leather materials require lower laser power, while thicker and harder leather materials require higher laser power.
                        <br>
                        <br>Laser frequency: The frequency is closely related to the quality and speed of drilling. Generally speaking, a frequency between 5000Hz and 10000Hz is most suitable.
                        <br>
                        <br>Scanning speed: The faster the scanning speed, the faster the drilling speed, but it may also affect the drilling quality. The scanning speed needs to be set and adjusted according to the characteristics of the leather material.
                        <br>
                        <br>Focal length: Focal length refers to the distance between the laser focal point and the leather surface. Laser cutting machine equipment usually has an automatic focusing function, which can automatically adjust the focal length according to the thickness of the leather material.</h4>

                            <br>
                            <br>Non contact machining: Laser cutting is a non-contact machining method that does not generate stress and causes minimal damage to ceramic materials.
                            <br>High precision: The laser spot is small and can achieve high-precision cutting, meeting the precision requirements of ceramic processing.
                            <br>Fast speed: Laser cutting is fast and can significantly improve production efficiency.
                            <br>High degree of automation: Laser cutting equipment usually uses computerized digital control technology (CNC) devices, which can easily receive cutting data from CAD workstations and achieve automated production.
