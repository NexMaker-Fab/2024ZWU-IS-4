                    <h2>Laser cutting machine cuts leather</h2>
                    <h4>Cutting effect:
                        <br>The laser cutting machine has a very good cutting effect on leather, which can achieve high cutting accuracy, fast speed, accurate cutting size, and smooth cutting edges. This is an advantage that traditional mechanical cutting machines cannot achieve.
                        <br>
                        <br>Parameter settings:
                        <br>Before laser cutting, it is necessary to set corresponding parameters based on the thickness, hardness, color and other properties of the leather material. These parameters include laser power, laser frequency, scanning speed, and focal length.
                        <br>
                        <br>Laser power: The laser power needs to be adjusted according to the thickness and hardness of the leather material. Generally speaking, thinner and softer leather materials require lower laser power, while thicker and harder leather materials require higher laser power.
                        <br>
                        <br>Laser frequency: The frequency is closely related to the quality and speed of drilling. Generally speaking, a frequency between 5000Hz and 10000Hz is most suitable.
                        <br>
                        <br>Scanning speed: The faster the scanning speed, the faster the drilling speed, but it may also affect the drilling quality. The scanning speed needs to be set and adjusted according to the characteristics of the leather material.
                        <br>
                        <br>Focal length: Focal length refers to the distance between the laser focal point and the leather surface. Laser cutting machine equipment usually has an automatic focusing function, which can automatically adjust the focal length according to the thickness of the leather material.</h4>

                        <h2>Laser cutting machine for cutting ceramics</h2>
                        <h4><br>The principle of laser cutting ceramics
                            <br>The laser cutting machine utilizes the thermal energy of the laser beam to achieve cutting. When the laser beam is irradiated on the surface of ceramics, it releases energy to melt and evaporate the ceramics, thereby achieving the purpose of cutting and carving.
                            <br>The advantages of laser cutting ceramics
                            <br>
                            <br>Non contact machining: Laser cutting is a non-contact machining method that does not generate stress and causes minimal damage to ceramic materials.
                            <br>High precision: The laser spot is small and can achieve high-precision cutting, meeting the precision requirements of ceramic processing.
                            <br>Fast speed: Laser cutting is fast and can significantly improve production efficiency.
                            <br>High degree of automation: Laser cutting equipment usually uses computerized digital control technology (CNC) devices, which can easily receive cutting data from CAD workstations and achieve automated production.

                                <h4><br>Introduction to CNC Lathe

                                    <br>A CNC lathe is an automated machinery equipment widely used in mechanical processing. It utilizes a numerical control system to process workpieces, boasting advantages such as high precision, high efficiency, and high flexibility. The CNC lathe is primarily used for cutting and machining operations on internal and external cylindrical surfaces of shaft or disk parts, internal and external conical surfaces with any taper angle, complex rotary internal and external curved surfaces, cylindrical and conical threads. Additionally, it can perform various processes like slotting, drilling, reaming, counterboring, and boring.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>The machining process of a CNC lathe is based on a pre-programmed machining program that details the processing route, technological parameters, tool path, displacement, cutting parameters, and auxiliary functions of the workpiece. These programs are compiled into a machining program sheet using the instruction codes and program formats specified by the CNC machine tool. The program is then recorded on a control medium and input into the CNC device of the CNC lathe, directing the machine tool to process the workpiece.
