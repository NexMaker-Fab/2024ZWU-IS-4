                    <h2>Laser cutting machine cuts leather</h2>
                    <h4>Cutting effect:
                        <br>The laser cutting machine has a very good cutting effect on leather, which can achieve high cutting accuracy, fast speed, accurate cutting size, and smooth cutting edges. This is an advantage that traditional mechanical cutting machines cannot achieve.
                        <br>
                        <br>Parameter settings:
                        <br>Before laser cutting, it is necessary to set corresponding parameters based on the thickness, hardness, color and other properties of the leather material. These parameters include laser power, laser frequency, scanning speed, and focal length.
                        <br>
                        <br>Laser power: The laser power needs to be adjusted according to the thickness and hardness of the leather material. Generally speaking, thinner and softer leather materials require lower laser power, while thicker and harder leather materials require higher laser power.
                        <br>
                        <br>Laser frequency: The frequency is closely related to the quality and speed of drilling. Generally speaking, a frequency between 5000Hz and 10000Hz is most suitable.
                        <br>
                        <br>Scanning speed: The faster the scanning speed, the faster the drilling speed, but it may also affect the drilling quality. The scanning speed needs to be set and adjusted according to the characteristics of the leather material.
                        <br>
                        <br>Focal length: Focal length refers to the distance between the laser focal point and the leather surface. Laser cutting machine equipment usually has an automatic focusing function, which can automatically adjust the focal length according to the thickness of the leather material.</h4>

                        <h2>Laser cutting machine for cutting ceramics</h2>
                        <h4><br>The principle of laser cutting ceramics
                            <br>The laser cutting machine utilizes the thermal energy of the laser beam to achieve cutting. When the laser beam is irradiated on the surface of ceramics, it releases energy to melt and evaporate the ceramics, thereby achieving the purpose of cutting and carving.
                            <br>The advantages of laser cutting ceramics
                            <br>
                            <br>Non contact machining: Laser cutting is a non-contact machining method that does not generate stress and causes minimal damage to ceramic materials.
                            <br>High precision: The laser spot is small and can achieve high-precision cutting, meeting the precision requirements of ceramic processing.
                            <br>Fast speed: Laser cutting is fast and can significantly improve production efficiency.
                            <br>High degree of automation: Laser cutting equipment usually uses computerized digital control technology (CNC) devices, which can easily receive cutting data from CAD workstations and achieve automated production.

                            Wear safety helmets, safety glasses, and other protective equipment.
                            Avoid wearing loose clothing or long hair that could get caught in the machine.
                            <br>Do Not Operate with Gloves:
                            Operating CNC machines with gloves is strictly prohibited to prevent accidents.
                            <br>Keep the Workspace Clear:
                            Do not place obstacles around the machine to ensure sufficient workspace.
                            Remove debris and clutter to maintain a clean and organized environment.
                            <br>Coordinate Teamwork:
                            When working with two or more people, ensure proper coordination and communication.
                            <br>Do Not Use Compressed Air for Cleaning:
                            Compressed air should not be used to clean the machine, electrical cabinets, or NC units.
                            <br>Strictly Follow Operating Procedures:
                            Any violation of operating procedures will be subject to disciplinary action.
                         <br>
                            <br>2.Pre-Operation Preparations
                            
                            <br>Check Lubrication System:
                            Ensure the lubrication system is functioning properly before starting the machine.
                            If the machine has not been used for a long time, manually lubricate the parts.
                            <br>Inspect Tools and Accessories:
                            Use tools and accessories that are compatible with the machine specifications.
                            Replace worn-out or damaged tools and accessories promptly.
                            <br>Close Safety Guards:
                            Ensure all safety guards and doors are closed securely before operating the machine.
                            <br>
                            <br>3. Safety During Operation
                            
                            <br>Avoid Direct Contact:
                            Do not touch the cutting tools, workpiece, or moving parts of the machine.
                            Use tools to remove debris and chips from the machine.
                            <br>Monitor Machine Status:
                            Regularly check the temperature and sound of the spindle to identify any abnormalities.
                            Stay alert and do not leave the machine unattended during operation.
                            <br>Do Not Modify Parameters:
                            Do not change the machine's parameters or settings without proper authorization.
                            <br>Handle Emergencies:
                            In case of emergencies, immediately press the emergency stop button to halt the machine.
                            <br>Program Execution:
                            Simulate the program graphically before running it on the machine.
                            Ensure the cutting tools are retracted to a safe distance before starting the machining process.
                            By strictly adhering to these safety measures, operators can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure safe and efficient CNC operation.</h4>
