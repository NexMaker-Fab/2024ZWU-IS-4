                    <h4><br>definition:
                        <br>Spring steel refers to steel specifically used for manufacturing springs and elastic components due to its elasticity in quenched and tempered states. The elasticity of steel depends on its ability to undergo elastic deformation, which enables it to withstand a certain load within a specified range without permanent deformation after the load is removed.
                    <br>
                        <br>Classification:
                        <br>Carbon spring steel
                        <br>The carbon content (mass fraction) of carbon spring steel is generally between 0.62% and 0.90%. According to its manganese content, it can be further divided into two categories: general manganese content (mass fraction) (0.50%~0.80%) such as 65, 70, 85, and higher manganese content (mass fraction) (0.90~1.20%) such as 65Mn.
                        <br>Alloy spring steel
                        <br>Alloy spring steel is a steel that improves the mechanical properties, hardenability, and other properties of carbon steel by adding one or several alloying elements appropriately, in order to meet the performance requirements for manufacturing various springs.

The carbon content is relatively low, and the plasticity and toughness are better than other spring steels. High hardenability and good fatigue performance are various important spiral springs, especially suitable for springs with high working stress amplitude and strict fatigue performance requirements, such as valve springs, fuel injector springs, cylinder expansion rings, safety valve springs, etc.</h4>

High temperature anti relaxation and hot working performance are also good for heat-resistant springs with working temperatures below 500~C, such as steam turbine main steam valve springs, steam seal spring plates, boiler safety valve springs, 400t boiler disc valve springs, etc.</h4>

Super large springs used in large civil engineering, heavy vehicles, machinery, etc., with good mechanical properties and anti tempering stability.

                        <br>Main material: The plastic fresh-keeping box is mainly made of PP (polypropylene) material. PP is a colorless, non-toxic, and odorless semi transparent solid substance, which is a common material for making fresh-keeping boxes.
                        <br>Features: The advantage of PP material preservation boxes is that they have good heat resistance and can withstand high temperatures of around 110 degrees Celsius. Therefore, they can be placed in a microwave for short-term heating. But its transparency is average, hardness is also poor, and improper use can easily cause scratches.

                            <br>The working principle of graphene batteries is similar to traditional batteries, mainly including two processes: charging and discharging.
                            <br>During the charging process, the current flows from an external power source to the battery. The positive electrode absorbs electrons and embeds ions into the positive electrode material, while the negative electrode releases electrons for external circuit use. This process will cause lithium or sodium ions in the positive electrode particles to embed into the positive electrode lattice, while electrons will flow towards the negative electrode through an external circuit.
                            <br>During the discharge process, embedded ions in the battery are released from the positive electrode and transferred to the negative electrode through the electrolyte. The negative electrode absorbs electrons and embeds ions into the negative electrode material, while the positive electrode releases electrons for external circuit use. By continuously cycling charge and discharge, graphene batteries can achieve energy storage and release functions.</h4>

                    <h2>Methods post processing for  metal</h2>
                    <h4>Anodizing is the electrochemical oxidation of metals or alloys, in which aluminum and its alloys form an oxide film on aluminum products (anodes) under specific electrolyte and process conditions through the action of an applied current.
                        <br>Process principle
                        <br>Anodic dissolution: In the anodizing process, aluminum alloy is placed as an anode in the electrolyte solution. When an external DC power supply is applied to the anode, a dissolution reaction begins, causing aluminum ions (Al ³+) to enter the electrolyte solution.
                        <br>Oxidation reaction: The acidic components in the electrolyte solution (such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc.) cause an oxidation reaction. Under the action of an external power source, aluminum ions undergo an oxidation reaction on the anode surface, generating aluminum oxide (Al ₂ O æ).
                        <br>Generating oxide film: Oxygen bubbles caused by oxidation reactions form small pores on the anode surface, which combine with aluminum ions on the anode surface to form a dense and uniform oxide film. This oxide film has ceramic like properties, excellent corrosion resistance, hardness, and wear resistance.

                    <h4>The reason for choosing resin clay as the main material for potted plants: Due to its high plasticity and strong texture, resin clay is commonly used to make simulated flowers, simulated food, etc. The simulated handicrafts produced by it are extremely close to the real product in terms of appearance, color, and texture, vivid and realistic, with a natural form. Resin clay has excellent ductility and can be made very thin and transparent, making it very suitable for making various delicate simulation works. Resin clay has strong extensibility and can be made very thin and transparent, with excellent coloring effect, almost achieving the effect of blurring the real.</h4>
                    <h4>The method of using resin clay to make potted plants
                        <br>Material preparation: 1. Prepare the required materials such as resin clay, carving tools, color powder, etc.
                        <br> 2. Take out the resin clay and knead it until it completely blends without any gaps. After kneading, gently pat the table a few times to expel the air from the clay.
                        <br>3. Conduct styling. Shape the required elements such as soil and plants on the base that we have prepared in advance.
                        <br>4. Wait for the resin clay to air dry naturally. After drying, use color powder to color the shaped clay.</h4>

                   <h4>Resin is an organic polymer material with various characteristics and wide applications. Resin usually refers to organic polymers that have a softening or melting range after being heated, and have a tendency to flow under external forces during softening. They are solid, semi-solid, and sometimes liquid at room temperature. In a broad sense, any polymer or prepolymer that can be used as a plastic substrate can be referred to as a resin.</h4>
