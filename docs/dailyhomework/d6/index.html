                    <h4>Anodizing is the electrochemical oxidation of metals or alloys, in which aluminum and its alloys form an oxide film on aluminum products (anodes) under specific electrolyte and process conditions through the action of an applied current.
                        <br>Process principle
                        <br>Anodic dissolution: In the anodizing process, aluminum alloy is placed as an anode in the electrolyte solution. When an external DC power supply is applied to the anode, a dissolution reaction begins, causing aluminum ions (Al ³+) to enter the electrolyte solution.
                        <br>Oxidation reaction: The acidic components in the electrolyte solution (such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc.) cause an oxidation reaction. Under the action of an external power source, aluminum ions undergo an oxidation reaction on the anode surface, generating aluminum oxide (Al ₂ O æ).
                        <br>Generating oxide film: Oxygen bubbles caused by oxidation reactions form small pores on the anode surface, which combine with aluminum ions on the anode surface to form a dense and uniform oxide film. This oxide film has ceramic like properties, excellent corrosion resistance, hardness, and wear resistance.</h4>

                    <h4>Injection molding process is a manufacturing method that injects molten plastic material into a mold and solidifies it through cooling. The entire process usually includes the following six stages:
                        <br>Heating and melting: Plastic particles or powders are heated to a molten state in an injection machine, becoming a viscous flowing melt.
                        <br>Filling mold: Melt is injected into the mold cavity under high pressure, filling the entire mold cavity.
                        <br>(Gas assisted, water assisted) pressure holding: During the filling process, a certain amount of pressure is applied to the melt to ensure that the mold cavity is completely filled and prevent melt backflow.
                        <br>Cooling solidification: The melt is cooled in the mold and gradually solidified into the desired shape of the plastic product. The cooling time and temperature depend on factors such as the type and thickness of the material.
                        <br>Mold opening: After cooling and solidification, the mold opens.
                        <br>Demolding: Remove the molded part from the mold.</h4>

                    <h4>The reason for choosing resin clay as the main material for potted plants: Due to its high plasticity and strong texture, resin clay is commonly used to make simulated flowers, simulated food, etc. The simulated handicrafts produced by it are extremely close to the real product in terms of appearance, color, and texture, vivid and realistic, with a natural form. Resin clay has excellent ductility and can be made very thin and transparent, making it very suitable for making various delicate simulation works. Resin clay has strong extensibility and can be made very thin and transparent, with excellent coloring effect, almost achieving the effect of blurring the real.</h4>
                    <h4>The method of using resin clay to make potted plants
                        <br>Material preparation: 1. Prepare the required materials such as resin clay, carving tools, color powder, etc.
                        <br> 2. Take out the resin clay and knead it until it completely blends without any gaps. After kneading, gently pat the table a few times to expel the air from the clay.
                        <br>3. Conduct styling. Shape the required elements such as soil and plants on the base that we have prepared in advance.
                        <br>4. Wait for the resin clay to air dry naturally. After drying, use color powder to color the shaped clay.</h4>

Resin usually refers to organic polymers that have a softening or melting range after being heated, and have a tendency to flow under external forces during softening. They are solid, semi-solid, and sometimes liquid at room temperature. In a broad sense, any polymer or prepolymer that can be used as a plastic substrate can be referred to as a resin.</h4>
