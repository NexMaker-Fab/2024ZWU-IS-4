                        <br>Anodic dissolution: In the anodizing process, aluminum alloy is placed as an anode in the electrolyte solution. When an external DC power supply is applied to the anode, a dissolution reaction begins, causing aluminum ions (Al ³+) to enter the electrolyte solution.
                        <br>Oxidation reaction: The acidic components in the electrolyte solution (such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc.) cause an oxidation reaction. Under the action of an external power source, aluminum ions undergo an oxidation reaction on the anode surface, generating aluminum oxide (Al ₂ O æ).
                        <br>Generating oxide film: Oxygen bubbles caused by oxidation reactions form small pores on the anode surface, which combine with aluminum ions on the anode surface to form a dense and uniform oxide film. This oxide film has ceramic like properties, excellent corrosion resistance, hardness, and wear resistance.
