                    <h2>Autonomous vehicle and connected vehicles</h2>
                    <h4>On the future road, vehicles will reach level 5 autonomous driving without the need for manual intervention. However, nowadays, car manufacturers and start-ups are working hard to ensure that Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving technologies are correct. Cameras, radars, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and many other onboard sensors are being used to capture road condition information, notify appropriate driving behavior, and prevent potential accidents. To achieve this goal, nearly 1TB of data will be stored in vehicles in the near future, and this amount of data will surge to over 2TB in the next decade.  
                    <br>   
                    <br>However, the future of cars is not just about autonomous driving. Cars will use "vehicle to everything" or "V2X" technology to communicate with each other, road infrastructure, and even pedestrians. Through this way of communication, you can manage the fleet of autonomous vehicle to make travel faster and safer.
